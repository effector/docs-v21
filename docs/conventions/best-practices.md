Effector provides you pretty powerful tooling to migrate all the remaining logic from views to your models(events, effects, stores and its connections in general)

Here are some advices with code examples:

## Store handlers

To avoid semantic inconsistency you handle all store updates with original store, not mapped ones since its values will be updated automatically.

```js title="src/models/users/index.js"
import {createStore, createEffect} from 'effector'

export const fetchUsersFx = createEffect()

//imagine initially we have users list as a key-value store
export const $usersMap = createStore({})

//we need array representaion for our UI tasks
export const $users = $usersMap.map(usersMap => Object.values(usersMap))
```

## File Structure

Any business logic could be split by models. You should create a folder for each model by its scope of responsibility in `/models` directory.

Every model consists of declarations and initialization file. So, declarations is `index.js` and initialization file is `init.js`.

Imagine we have another responsibility scope with bigger `index.js`, so we had to separate store declarations into `state.js` to improve readability

```
.
├── models/
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── init.js
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   ├── state.js
│   │   └── init.js
│   └── init.js
├── App.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

Root `init.js` imports **all** init files from models.

```js title="models/init.js"
import 'users/init'
import 'auth/init'
```

It should be imported in your app root.

```js title="index.jsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

//root component
import {App} from './App'

import './models/init'

//Here could be any view framework initialization
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Init file in model exports nothing, it **only** imports events, stores, effects from different models.
This is a place where you initialize your effects and store handlers, to keep other modules pure. Just after that, you start buildling the dataflow of the model (connecting Units aka `forward`, `sample`, `guard`, `merge`, `split`)

Init files as well could contain imports from another models to deal with cross-model business-logic.

```js title="models/users/init.js"
import {forward} from 'effector'
import {fetchUsersFx, $usersMap} from './'

fetchUsersFx.use(async () => fetch('/users'))

addUserFx.use(async user =>
  fetch('/users', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(user),
  }),
)

$usersMap.on(fetchUsersFx.doneData, (_, users) => users)

forward({
  from: addUserFx.doneData,
  to: fetchUsersFx,
})
```
