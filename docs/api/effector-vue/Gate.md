_Gate_ is a hook for conditional rendering, based on current value (or values) in props. An example of a problem that Gate can solve - you can put together all required data, when component was mounted.

This allows you to send props back to _Store_ to create feedback loop.

Gate can be used via [useGate](./useGate.md) hook. Gate stores and events can be used in the application as regular units

Gate can have two states:

- **Open**, which means mounted
- **Closed**, which means unmounted
